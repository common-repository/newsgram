<p>First of all, you need to create a channel. To create a channel, you need the Telegram app installed on your SmartPhone just click the button at the right of the search line. In the pop-up window, you will be offered to create a group or a channel. Choose “New Channel” and click “Next”.<p>

<div align="center">
<?php
echo '<img src="' . plugins_url( 'images/new_channel.jpg', dirname(__FILE__) ) . '" > ';
?>
</div>
 
<p>On the next step, you will be offered to write a name, description and set up the main picture. Then you can also choose whether it will be a Private or Public channel. <strong>To be able to build community and schedule content, please choose the Public channel option. Important: Choose and write a bundle for your link (it can be shared with other Telegram users as an invite link).</strong></p>


<div align="center">
<?php
echo '<img src="' . plugins_url( 'images/public.jpg', dirname(__FILE__) ) . '" > ';
?>
</div>

<p> Brilliant! On the next step, you can invite people from your contact list. Your channel is created. Now it is high time to create a bot, and connect it to Telegram.<br />

 You don’t need to write any code for this. In fact, you don’t even need your computer! Go to the telegram app on your phone and…<br />

Search for the “botfather” telegram bot (he’s the one that’ll assist you with creating and managing your bot)
Type /help to see all possible commands the botfather can handle<br />

Click on or type /newbot to create a new bot.</p>

<div align="center">
<?php
echo '<img src="' . plugins_url( 'images/newbot.jpg', dirname(__FILE__) ) . '" > ';
?>
</div>


<p>Follow instructions and make a new name for your bot. If you are making a bot just for experimentation, it can be useful to namespace your bot by placing your name before it in its username, since it has to be a unique name. Although, its screen name can be whatever you like. <strong>You should see a new API token generated for it. Copy this Token and paste into newsgram settings.</strong> After setting up your bot, add it as the channel admin by clicking on the channel name and choosing channel admin.
